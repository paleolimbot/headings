The goal of headings is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paleolimbot/headings")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(headings)

# totally bogus since 0 and 360 are identical!
mean(c(350, 355, 360, 0, 5, 10))
sd(c(350, 355, 360, 0, 5, 10))

# everybody wins!
hdg_mean(c(350, 355, 360, 0, 5, 10))
hdg_sd(c(350, 355, 360, 0, 5, 10))
```

Practically, heading arithmetic can be used to summarize climate and/or current directions over time.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(weathercan)

# get some climate data
kam <- weathercan::weather_dl(
  station_ids = 51423,
  start = "2016-01-01",
  end = "2016-12-31"
)

kam %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean(wind_dir, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd(wind_dir, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
